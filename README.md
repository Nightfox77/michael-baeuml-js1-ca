A Website with most of the characters of the Star Wars universe

## Description

The website was made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
After quite some searching I finally found an API that works without any problems. The content in the cards and the details page
are called from this API. I made sure that if some data is missing the word unknown is displayed instead of undefined or Nan. The one problem I
couldn`t solve is that some of the image URLs are not working and can`t be loaded. I planned to insert a placeholder image but after coding different solutions 
I had to give up.
